# Changelog

## Unreleased — 0.1.0

Project scaffolding. No player-facing functionality yet.

- Design spec finalised (`tallybook-mod-spec.md`).
- Client-only mod skeleton: `modinfo.json` (`"side": "Client"`, requires game 1.22.0) and a
  `ModSystem` gated to `EnumAppSide.Client`.
- Compat regression harness (`tools/compat-test.ps1`): headless dedicated-server boots for
  every mod combination, with Pin Matrix as the companion mod. Fails on server-log errors or
  warnings, wrong mod count/load order, a missing assembly-load marker, or any loss of
  server-side silence.
- Game-version sweep (`tools/version-sweep.ps1`): builds one artifact and runs the full
  compat matrix against real dedicated servers for 1.22.0 through 1.22.6. Server packages are
  extracted with verification against the archive's entry count and a completion stamp, and
  setup problems are reported as `SETUP` rather than being misattributed as a mod failure.
